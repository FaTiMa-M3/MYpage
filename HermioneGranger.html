    <h4 class="text">
     Hermione Granger, the feminist icon, the book-smart queen and the main reason Harry and Ron weren't killed or worse <em>expelled</em>. She is an icon
     <br>and a legend. She is a part of the Golden Trio and one of Harry's best friends. I enjoy seeing how she quickly uses her intelligence and strength
     <br>and her character development throughout the series.

    <h3 class="subtitles">Rating:7/10</h3>
    <h4 class="text"> 
     Hermione gets a 7/10 because while I love her she has some traits which bug me to no end. Her bad traits that annoy me the most are:
      <ul>
      <li>Her absolute belief she is right and how she doesn't admit when she's wrong (her attitude towards the firebolt, crookshanks and Trelawnwy)</li>
        <li>Her need to be the best (The Half-blood prince book saga)</li>
        <li>She does what <em>she</em>believes is best for other, not what is actually good (S.P.E.W)</li>
        <li>She is vindictive and has extremely violent burst of anger (Set birds on Ron, punched Draco and also cursed the DADA poster to leave lasting 
        <br>scars on traitors)</li>
        <li>Perfectionist. Hermione has a clear fear of being a failure. (Her boggart turns into Professor Mcgonagall telling her she failed and her 
        <br>reaction to her OWL results)
      </ul>
      There are many more and few are actually mentioned in the books, leaving the rest as if they didn't exist. It is almost as if J.K Rowling made Hermione
      <br> her perfect character and pushes down her flaws. It is really annoying to hear mostly that Hermione is smart and powerful and kind when I would've
      <br>liked an arc where she accepts she isn't perfect and it's ok to fail. But instead we get a perfectionist, vindictive hero who must always be right.
      <br>
      <br>Not to say Hermione isn't without her good qualities. She isn't just intelligent and powerful but also determined, hard-working and compassionate.
      <br>It may be hard to see it but she is more then just smart. In the Deathly Hallows, she was the one to comfort Harry when at his parents grave. To
      <br>save both of them from Nagini. To heal Ron when he was injured. To put the blame on herself when Harry and Ron saved her from a mountain troll. 
      <br>To protect her parents by making them forget who she was. She truly cares about all her friends and family and goes to massive legnths to protect them.
