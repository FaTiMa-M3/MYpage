      Harry Potter, also known as the boy who lived, is the main character of the story. He is described as having black, scruffy hair,
      green eyes and a thin lightning bolt scar on his forehead. His scar came from when Voldemort tried to kill him. He descovers on his 11 birthday 
      <br>he is a wizard, famous for his scar and navigates the Wizarding world as a celebrity.
      <br>Harry lives with his aunt Petunia Dursley, uncle Vernon Dursley and cousin Dudley in number 4 privet drive. None of them are magical or nice to 
      <br>Harry at all. They hate Harry because he has magic and punish him for it. Regardless, Harry persists and manages to attend Hogwarts school of witchcraft 
      <br>and wizardry, despite all the Dursleys efforts. He always has a grand time there and misses it dearly when it's time to return.

    <h3>Rating: 8/10</h3>

      Harry gets an 8/10 because he is an amazing character. He is humble, loyal, funny, relatable and overall intresting to read about. I enjoy reading as he learns more about The Wizarding world and his destiny.
