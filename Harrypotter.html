      Harry Potter, also known as the boy who lived, is the main character of the story. He descovers on his 11 birthday he is a wizard, famous for his scar
      <br>and navigates the Wizarding world as a celebrity. Harry lives with his aunt Petunia Dursley, uncle Vernon Dursley and cousin Dudley in number 4 
      <br>privet drive. None of them are magical or nice to Harry at all. They hate Harry because he has magic and punish him for it. Regardless, Harry persists 
      <br>and manages to attend Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, despite all the Dursleys efforts. He always has a grand time there and misses it dearly 
      <br>when it's time to return back to the muggle world.

    <h3 class="subtitles">Rating: 8/10</h3>
    <h4 class="text"> 
      Harry gets an 8/10 because while he is a good mix of good and bad none of his flaws are properly show up for him to overcome. Some of his flaws are:
   <ul>
     <li>He is emotionally immature and weak which makes him very impulsive (His lash out to Seamus, plans to kill Sirius and his early rage
     <br>towards his friends in Order of the Pheonix)</li>
     <li>He doesn't trust others and feels the need to take things into his own hands (He flew to the department of mysteries 
       <br> without listening to anyone around him and with no plan to save Sirius)</li>
     <li>When he believes he is without a doubt correct, Harry can be very self-righteous (He was very closed-minded when he made the theory about
       <br> the Deathly Hallows on little to no eveidence at all)
      </ul>
      These flaws are the main cause for heaps of trouble that could've been avoided. If he had listened to his friends and tried to keep a level-head, 
      <br>the Battle of the Department of Mysteries may have not been so disatrous. His occainsional self-righteous and arrogant attitude is never addressed
      <br> and his impulsive rage leads him to make stupid choices.
      <br>
      <br>He still has good qualities that out-weigh his bad ones. His main ones are:
      <ul>
        <li>Bravery (Snuck into the Ministry of Magic, formed the DA even though it was banned)</li>
         <li>He will sacrifice himself, if it will saves others (He willingly let Voldemort attempt to kill him in Deathly Hallows)</li>
        <li>He is loyal. Harry never leaves his friends and showed genuine friendship to all (His friendship with Ron and Hermione)</li>
      <li> He forgives people. At the end of the series, Harry has no long-time grudges towards anyone except Voldemort, not Percy, Draco or even Snape</li>
      </ul>
      Harry is overall a good character, who does his best to help others. He never stands down and teaches us the importance of love, friendship and
      <br>standing up for what is right even if you stand alone.
